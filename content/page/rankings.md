Is there anything so aesthetically pointless as a rankings list of your favorite books? Yeah, probably. But fact is it's a nice thing for me, the author of this weblog. It's a nice way for me to think over things I've read in my head by giving myself a simple little goal to think for, the same way ants probably run faster when there's sugar involved (not looking that up though.)

In short, these ranks are completely authoritative. They convey exactly how, on the day I put them together, I felt.


## Vonnegut Novels {#vonnegut-novels}

As of 2022ish, at least, when I re-read them. I was a teenager once. That means I will always have a soft spot for these.


### Breakfast of Champions {#breakfast-of-champions}


### Slaughterhouse 5 {#slaughterhouse-5}


### Bluebeard {#bluebeard}


### Cat's Cradle {#cat-s-cradle}

What a `great` example of why this list form _sucks_: is this `really` worse than Bluebeard? I dont know, maybe slightly? I only put it higher because it was written after Reagan, and therefore better reflects now


### Ones I don't care enough about to rank. I guess its just the ones I found bad, or at least boring, or maybe never finished reading: {#ones-i-don-t-care-enough-about-to-rank-dot-i-guess-its-just-the-ones-i-found-bad-or-at-least-boring-or-maybe-never-finished-reading}

-   The Sirens of Titan
-   God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater
-   Slapstick
-   Jailbird
-   Deadeye Dick


## Stephen King Novels and Novellas {#stephen-king-novels-and-novellas}

I have been reading these along with the Just King Things podcast, though tbh I don't much like Steven King. Why, then? Simple: I am an American. This means that, whether I want them to be or not, Stephen King's thoughts and words have formed me, and my view of this small, somewhat American world.


### Pet Semetary {#pet-semetary}

God, this is just so good! King's work, to me, often suffers from its reactionary character, but here, fully focused on reactionary, heterosexual life, it's his greatest asset: its habitus creates the horror of the work


### Christine {#christine}

The most perfect satire of american suburban culture, done so aptly I cannot tell if it's on purpose or not.


### Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption {#rita-hayworth-and-shawshank-redemption}

No one better knows how to write a sentimental novella!


### The Shining {#the-shining}


### Carrie {#carrie}


### Cujo {#cujo}

If only the whole book were as tense and fantastic as the last half!


### The Breathing Method {#the-breathing-method}


### The Dead Zone {#the-dead-zone}


### Apt Pupil {#apt-pupil}

In which Stephen King realizes the unpleasant nature of American white supremacy and, afraid, steps back and says, nah, sometimes people are just bad.


### Firestarter {#firestarter}


### The Stand {#the-stand}


### 'Salem's Lot {#salem-s-lot}


### Ones I don't enjoy enough to rank: {#ones-i-don-t-enjoy-enough-to-rank}

-   The Gunslinger
-   The Body
-   The Mist


## Haruki Murakami Short Stories {#haruki-murakami-short-stories}

Look: I have been reading these in Japanese, and this _really_ helps motivate me to get through the slog of some of his earlier, weaker stories. I am putting in the effort. Stranger, please be proud.


### Slow Boat to China {#slow-boat-to-china}

I recalled ~really​~ liking this one. Turns out I just ~really​~ liked the section in the middle when the narrator accidentally let the girl get lost on the train. Still: what a great, small section!


### A Poor Aunt Story {#a-poor-aunt-story}

I struggled with this one, especially with the work of reading in an unfamiliar language. Oh well.
