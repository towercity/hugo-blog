Yes, though it looks the same as my last site, I've moved it to a new, lighter backend engine. This is incredibly convenient for me. I hope you enjoy this fact vicariously.

What happened to my old posts? They are gone. This represents the fact that the past quickly becomes inaccessible to all of us. Nothing of interest from the old site is lost.
